_Mini-Project for COMP61011 - University of Manchester_

**An Implementation and Analysis of a Random Forest as an Ensemble Method for Classification**

The project provides an analysis and survey of the Random Forest machine learning algorithm, for classification. RFs are one of the most popular models for resolving machine learning problems.  They're relatively new in comparison to  other alternatives and as such are a fertile  ground for  experimentation. By revising and analyzing in depth the algorithms of RF, decision trees and  decision stump, this project delivers a throughout overview of different optimization and enhancements of RF.It also serves as a point of comparison within the parameters an behavior inside the very RF and carries out further comparisons with Support Vector Machines.

This repository also contains some of the coursework exercises developed.
